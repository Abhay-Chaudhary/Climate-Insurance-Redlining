# Who’s Being Priced Out of Protection? Predicting FAIR Plan Enrollment in California

## Project Overview
California's residential insurance market faces unprecedented disruption as major insurers retreat due to escalating wildfire risk, construction cost increases, and volatile reinsurance markets. State Farm, the state's largest residential insurer, suspended new policy issuance in 2023 and did not renew about 72,000 existing policies. Insurers are now passing higher premiums to consumers and pushing homeowners toward the California FAIR Plan—a state-backed insurance program that provides basic property coverage when traditional insurers refuse to write policies. In Sacramento County, FAIR Plan usage more than doubled in one year. With FAIR Plan resources limited (about $377 M liquidity, as of Jan 2025), regulators and advocates warn of an “uninsurable future” for wildfire-exposed homeowners.
This analysis examines whether FAIR Plan enrollment patterns and financial liability can be predicted using disaster risk exposure, socioeconomic indicators, and insurance cost metrics. Developing a reliable forecasting model would enable policymakers, community organizations, and homeowners to anticipate coverage gaps, allocate resources proactively, and identify communities vulnerable to insurance market disruption.


## Objectives
* Analyze geographic and demographic disparities in insurance availability and premiums.
* Investigate whether climate disasters correlate with increased insurance withdrawal.
* Predict where the FAIR Plan is likely to fill coverage gaps due to private insurer withdrawal.
* Explore the intersection between income, housing values, climate events, and insurance trends.

## Major Steps

1. **Data Acquisition & Cleaning**
    * Gather data on:
        * Median household income
        * Housing values
        * Population demographics
        * Historical climate disasters
        * Insurance premium data
    * Clean and uniformize data to zip code-level granularity

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**
    * Visualize trends across zip codes
    *

3. **Modeling & Prediction**
    * Build predictive models to estimate:
    * 
    * 
    * Assess which features are most predictive (e.g., disaster frequency, income, housing density)
