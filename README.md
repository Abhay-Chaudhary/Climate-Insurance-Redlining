## Project Overview
As climate disasters increase in frequency and intensity, insurance companies across the globe, and in particular, in California, are reassessing risk and, in many cases, withdrawing coverage or raising premiums in high-risk areas. This shift leaves vulnerable populations at greater financial risk and places an additional burden on the California FAIR Plan, which is a fire insurance pool made up of all insurers licensed to offer property and casualty coverage in California. It was created by state law in August 1968 (California Insurance Code §10090 et seq.) as a last-resort insurance option for those who cannot obtain coverage through the regular market.

This project investigates the relationship between climate risk, demographic and socioeconomic indicators, and insurance coverage patterns across California counties. We aim to identify whether there are patterns of climate-driven redlining, where communities—especially lower-income or historically marginalized groups—are disproportionately losing access to affordable insurance protection.

## Objectives
* Analyze geographic and demographic disparities in insurance availability and premiums.
* Investigate whether climate disasters correlate with increased insurance withdrawal.
* Predict where the FAIR Plan is likely to fill coverage gaps due to private insurer withdrawal.
* Explore the intersection between income, housing values, climate events, and insurance trends.

## Major Steps

1. **Data Acquisition & Cleaning**
    * Gather data on:
        * Median household income
        * Housing values
        * Population demographics
        * Historical climate disasters
        * Insurance premium data
    * Clean and uniformize data to zip code-level granularity

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**
    * Visualize trends across zip codes
    *

3. **Modeling & Prediction**
    * Build predictive models to estimate:
    * 
    * 
    * Assess which features are most predictive (e.g., disaster frequency, income, housing density)
